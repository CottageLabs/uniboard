# In order to install uniboard you need to run 
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# (i.e. target this file with the -r switch on pip).

# first get esprit, specifically the version we know will work (+ it's
# not on PyPI)
-e git+https://github.com/richard-jones/esprit.git@fccee02c3c72f8e5db0d7d0924322f54094d3e1f#egg=esprit

# now run the normal setup.py and get all the normal PyPI dependencies from there
-e .
